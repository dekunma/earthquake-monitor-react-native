## Usage  
**1. Install dependencies:**  
in the root directory, do:   
```shell
yarn install
```
please make sure that you have already installed [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)  
<br/>

**2. Environment setup:**  
Configure React Native environment on your machine properly according to the [official guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).  
You only need to configure the android environment since we only support android by far.  
If you are in China, we strongly recommend you follow [this guide provided by China React Native community](https://reactnative.cn/docs/environment-setup).  
We also strongly encourage you using a **real android device** instead of the emulator.
<br/>  
<br/>

**3.1. Start the app (development mode)**  
in the root directory, do:  
```shell
yarn react-native run-android  
```  
or  
```shell
yarn android  
```  
If the above process takes a long time (>= 5 minutes), you can open **/android** directory in **android studio** and let it download dependencies automatically, and then run the above command to start the app.  
<br/>  
<br/>

**3.2. Start the app (release mode)**  
in the root directory, do:  
```shell
yarn react-native run-android --variant=release  
```  
make sure the above command builds the app sucessfully before moving on to releasing.  
<br/>
<br/>

**4. Build the APK file**  
Please follow [this guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android)  
to generate keystore and use gradle wrapper to build.  
You **do not need** to build a bundle before building the APK file.

## Acknowledgement  
This app is based on the concepts and design of the IOS app [地震监测](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/%E5%9C%B0%E9%9C%87%E7%9B%91%E6%B5%8B/id1480798720#?platform=iphone) developed by [老腊肉](https://github.com/laolarou726).  
The UI of this app is primarily accomplished by adapting [UI Kitten](https://github.com/akveo/react-native-ui-kitten).   
The API is provided by [US Geological Survey](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/).
